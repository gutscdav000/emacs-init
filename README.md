add the following to the end of an org file that you want org-ai-mode enabled it. Note, we're not enabling it by default because it conflicts with verb-mode. 
```
# Local Variables:
# eval: (org-ai-mode)
# End:
```

## only install a package in a shell:
```

# install software in a single shell sesion:
`nix shell nixpkgs#gh`

## lsp-mode using the wrong root directory for a project?
sometimes it will default to `~/` or `~/repositories` to fix this use the following command(s), then reimport metals projects
- `lsp-workplace-remove-all-folders`
- `lsp-workplace-folders-remove`

# when upgrading Mac verions do this because darwin is a clunky piece of shit
## osx overwrites the /etc/bashrc, zsh, and zprofile because they want you to suffer

update your bashrc or zshrc respectively to include the following encantation at the bottom of the file:
```
# Nix
if [ -e '/nix/var/nix/profiles/default/etc/profile.d/nix-daemon.sh' ]; then
  source '/nix/var/nix/profiles/default/etc/profile.d/nix-daemon.sh'
fi
# End Nix

```
start a new shell and you should have nix on the path again.
